You are a great blackhat willing to turn towards the white side.  The
Strategic Cyber Defense team from DARPA/DoD asks you to give a hand in
penetrating the mothership server of a well known terrorist group
operating from Kuraq. As you know they were defeated a few years ago,
however they are now back and DARPA has little information on them.
(I'm not even making this up! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gABzKZN38)


This server is known to be used for their custom information reporting
and they have their own protocol. They don't have much information on
it but they know that it is accessed with a custom client software to
connect to the server.  They also know from infiltrated agents that
they did throw in most of existing protections in place:
- Address Space Layout Randomization
- Stack canaries
- Non executable stacks 

Moreover, the server is running GRSecurity a well known patch for the
Linux kernel, with all security features enabled...  You don't even
have an account on the server so you can only access it remotely. The
group is also known to use some steganography tools (TIP: use the
"outguess" tool installed on the server!).

Well that's all the information they had before loosing all contacts
with their undercover agent.

Your usual pentester package is on the challenge/chall4/ folder on
your homedir, there you can find :
- a file with some information that may be useful at some point
- an apparently useless picture
- any other tools you like to use are allowed

Good luck and remember you are operating as a covert agent, think
before acting and avoid being too noisy those people can be dangerous!
(in practice this means: no network level attacks, no Kernel level
attacks, no physical attacks on devices or people, no attacking VM
hosts, no DoS, you get the idea...)

Good luck !
