The Path to Victory
==============================

Here you are, with a fresh user-account on the syssec-lab-server.
As seen in your last challenge, you have to get the secret file located in
challenges/challX.

This time, we are going to tease you and give you a program which visualizes
whether the flag is there or not. Show us, why this is a bad idea when done wrong
(as intentionally in this case). :)
