In this challenge, you have to exploit an old kernel-vulnerability.

You can start your virtual machine with ./qemu_runner.

The login for the machine is chall:chall - get root and obtain the
contents of /private.

Tips:
1) Develop the exploit on the vagrant box, or a copy of the qemu-image
2) On the virtual machine hosted here, ctrl+c will exit
3) The virtual machine DOES NOT save your data
4) If the token on the virtual machine looks wrong, try a reboot
   (Your exploit may have corrupted the file system!)

Good luck and have fun!
