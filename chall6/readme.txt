Who's there? 
==============================

This time, you have to solve a network challenge.
The rumor is that there is a secret service running on this server, which is
protecting the secret for every user.
We saw someone connecting to it and sniffed the traffic...

Now it's your time to connect to the service - good luck!

(Note: You can use 'sftp' to download the traffic file to your computer)
